# Heart Disease Analysis Report

## Overview
This report presents an analysis of heart disease data using **R Studio**. The dataset includes demographic information and various medical measurements for a group of patients. The primary goals of this analysis are to:
- Identify risk factors for heart disease.
- Examine the relationship between chest pain and heart disease.
- Explore how age and gender influence the risk of heart disease.

## Methodology
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
  - Visualizations and statistical techniques were used to examine relationships between variables and the presence of heart disease.
- **Predictive Modeling:** 
  - A Logistic Regression model was employed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various features.

## Key Findings
1. **Risk Factors for Heart Disease:**
   - Chest pain, gender, and the number of major vessels (ca) were identified as significant risk factors.
2. **Protective Factors:**
   - Regular exercise and routine medical check-ups may have a protective effect.
3. **Chest Pain Analysis:**
   - Different types of chest pain were evaluated to understand their association with heart disease.

## Results
- The Logistic Regression model effectively predicted the likelihood of heart disease based on key factors such as chest pain, gender, and major vessels.
- Results underscore the importance of monitoring specific demographic and medical variables to assess heart disease risk.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Software Used:** R Studio
- **Techniques:**
  - Data visualization for EDA
  - Logistic regression for predictive modeling

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the risk factors and protective measures for heart disease. Key variables like chest pain, gender, and major vessels have significant impacts on heart disease risk. Further research could explore additional predictors and validate findings with larger datasets.
